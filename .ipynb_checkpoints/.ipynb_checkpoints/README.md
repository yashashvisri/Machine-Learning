### Welcome 100 days of Machine Learning Day_2

Today I learnt about the data analysis using the single columns, i.e Univariate Analysis.
This can be done for the two types of data i.e Categorical and Numerical using different libraries.
I have used Seaborn for performing the EDA on categorical data on the Titanic_Survival Dataset. 
I will try to update this and add more information related to the EDA(Univariate), as this is not the final document for this topic.

### Happy Learning
