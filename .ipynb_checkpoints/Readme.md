### Welcome to 100 Days of Machine Learning of Day_3!!

Today I just learnt how to plot graphs using mupltiple columns i.e Multivariate analysis including Bivariate as well.
Not using all the plots right now, but I will update it later, this time it is just for the learning purpose.
I have used Titanic Dataset for this, the Iris and flight and passangers dataset can also be used for the better umderstanding of the different attributes of seaborn library and for different type of plot as well.

I will try to update this repo with the other graphs using differnet attributes very soon!!

#### Happy Learning!!
#### Happy Coding!!
